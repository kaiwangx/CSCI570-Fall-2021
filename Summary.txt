Comments on why the efficient and basic versions have different memory and time plots.
    The efficient version has a smaller memory usage since we only need to keep the last row of the m*n table (m, n
    stands for the size of two sequence). Here in my implementation, the size of allocated arr is in size of Theta(n),
    whereas the size needed by the basic version is Theta(m*n)

    The efficient version needs more cpu time since it has a recursive divide and conquer algorithm used to find the
    actually alignment. We have shown in class that the complexity of the efficient version is O(2*m*n).
